c# My Project (minimal React)

Minimal Vite + React app (no router) for quick run and testing.

Run (requires Node.js):

```powershell
cd 'C:\Hung\My Project\Menu'
npm install
npm run dev
```

If Node is not installed, use the `html/` folder and serve it with Python or Netlify (see previous README notes).
